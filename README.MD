# Monkey-rs

This repository is dedicated to building an interpreter for the [Monkey programming language](https://monkeylang.org/), implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The primary goal from this project is to learn and practice Rust programming.

## Overview

This project is inspired and follows the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/), but the implementation is done using Rust.

## Challenges

To complicate the exercise, I imposed on myself certain technical constraints:

- No libraries are allowed.
- No Regex is allowed.
